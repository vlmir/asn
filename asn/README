### Pre-processing CIFF files 
## Args:
- path to data dir 
- path to work dir 
- number of closest points to keep 
- CIFF file section (2 - for heteroatoms) 
- list of atom symbols, all metals if blank 
perl aux/strainer.pl cif . 32 2 FE MN > strainer-p32-FE-MN.out
# takes ~6h for the complete PDB
# silently creates and fills up a directory for intermediate files 'ssv'
# this feature is NOT essential, can be safely desabled in the Perl script to save space and time
## output file fields: 
- active center index
- x
- y
- z
- RMSD to the center, angstrem
- atom type, metals: 1..n, non-metals: 0
- PDB atom index, original!
- PDB entry index

### Network construction

make # compilation 
make run # execution 
make more # auxiliary files for further development and debugging 
make clean # delete object and dependency files 
make cleanall # delete ALL files generated by make 

## output file solus.ssv 
# fields:
- Cloud X index, set-wide 
- Cloud Y index, set-wide 
- PDB X ID 
- PDB Y ID 
- metal type X (1, 2, ...)
- metal type Y (1, 2, ...)
- RMSD X-Y 
- diff X-Y vs Y-X (asymmetry)
